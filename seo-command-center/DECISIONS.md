# DECISIONS.md — decision & learnings log

A short running note of the real choices you made: what you tried, what failed and why, what
you changed. This is your engineering judgement on the record — it is what separates a builder
from a button-presser, and it is graded (challenge brief section 08).

Append a 1–2 line entry whenever you make a real decision or hit/fix a wall. Add a timestamp.

Format:
`[HH:MM] <decision or problem> → <what you did and why>`

<!-- ---

## Example (replace with your own)
- `[10:20]` Chose plain-csv parsing over pandas → fewer deps, fast enough for 5k rows, model
  quota saved for the fixer.
- `[11:05]` Title detector over-counted duplicates → realized non-indexable pages were
  included; added an indexable+200 filter (per rulebook).
- `[12:40]` Dashboard wasn't updating live → MCP tool wasn't emitting the SSE event; added
  `_emit("issue", row)` in extract.

--- -->

## My log
- `[14:57]` added int and float to explicitly handle None, empty string and whitespace strings making them return default value or calling out exception.
also normalised url and strip strings for clean retrievel.


`[16:08]` asked the claude code to review the json file and compare it to the schema. It gave a major result of not being consistent which would give a bad output in other cases.
